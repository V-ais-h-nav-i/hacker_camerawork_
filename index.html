      <h1>Hi I'm Pavan</h1>
      <p>
        During the trying times of the Covid-19 pandemic, a period many of us
        found to be particularly challenging, I embarked on a quest to uncover
        my true passion. It was during these uncertain days that I stumbled upon
        the enchanting world of photography. In the early days, my fascination
        with photography manifested as a mere curiosity. I eagerly joined
        friends on their photoshoots, knowing little more about the camera than
        the names Canon and Nikon. My focus was not on the technical aspects;
        rather, I reveled in the art of capturing moments frozen in time. I
        vividly recall my third photoshoot, a pivotal moment in my journey.
        Guided by a friend, I took my first photograph. It was as though a spark
        had been ignited within me. The very next day, I sought out a camera for
        rent, determined to explore this newfound passion. I began taking
        photographs, experimenting with different modes, and eagerly examining
        the results. As I delved deeper into the realm of photography, my hunger
        for knowledge grew. I voraciously devoured resources on camera models,
        specifications, and techniques. Armed with Google and YouTube, I
        absorbed both theoretical concepts and practical know-how. Gradually, my
        skills improved with each snapshot, and I began to decipher the
        intricate checklist of elements necessary for crafting exceptional
        images. The path became clearer with every click of the shutter, and I
        knew I had unearthed my true passion. This revelation prompted me to
        invest in my own camera, solidifying my commitment to this captivating
        craft. Since then, my journey with photography has been a continuous and
        enriching exploration.
